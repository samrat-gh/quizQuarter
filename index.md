### Torque/Moment of force

The Turning effect of force is called torque.
It is denoted by **&#x1D70F;**

**&#x1D70F;** &Proportional;; Force Applied
**&#x1D70F;** &Proportional; moment arm
**&#x1D70F;** &Proportional; &theta; (angle between outward direction of moment arm and force arm)
**&#x1D70F;** &Proportional; Fsin&theta;\* r
$\vec{\tau}$ &Proportional; $\vec{F}$.$\vec{r}$

### Moment of Inertia

&rarr; Mass in linear motion is equivalent to moment of inertia in rotational motion.
&rarr; Inertia is inability of an object to change its state.  
&rarr; Moment of Inertia is tendency of an object to resist angulat acceleration.
&rarr; It is denoted by &tau;

We know,

> F = ma
> rF = rma
> &tau; = rm \* &alpha;r
> &tau; = mr
